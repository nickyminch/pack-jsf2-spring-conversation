/**
 * CallBacks should be invoked at the end of a @{link ConversationContext} life.
 * A CallBack allows the creator of the conversation context to know which action led to the context termination and to retrieve 
 * any relevant output.
 * For example, a conversation context can be created to let a user select an entity among a list of entities. When the user selects 
 * an entity, the action invokes the selected(T entity) method which let the creator of the context do something with the selected 
 * entity (e.g add it or set it somewhere...).
